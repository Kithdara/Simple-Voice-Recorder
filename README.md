# Simple-Voice-Recorder

We created a "Simple Voice Recorder" for our **Semester 2** Lab project at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa. 

**TASK** : Design and implement a simple voice recorder capable of recording, saving, selectively playing back multiple voice recordings, and adding adjustments to the spectrum during playback. 

Our project was successful in recording, saving, and playing back up to three recordings. Furthermore, we were successful in adding three adjustments; Down sampling, enhancing, shifting to the spectrum during playback. 

Recording and playback of our voice recorder are based on the **TMRpcm library** which samples at **16 kHz** and encodes **8 bits per sample**. Voice recordings were saved on an SD card. The final breadboard design, based on the **ATmega328-PU** single-chip microcontroller consists of four push buttons that interact with the user interface through an LCD. Our project is complete with a validated PCB and Enclosure design.
